# EPD Router Configuration

{% hint style="info" %}
This section primarily introduces the management of EPD Routers. Through this chapter, we can configure the **`tx-power`** and **`channel`** settings of the EPD Router. These two values significantly affect the wireless communication strength of the EPD Router at a given site. By optimizing these settings, you can significantly improve the performance and reliability of wireless communications between the EPD Router and EPD devices, enhancing the overall efficiency of image transmissions.
