> There are two license activation options: apply for a free trial (90-Day) via the **Request Form (method 1) or** directly purchase using the **SAP flow from Advantech (method 2)** . Both require the **License Request Code**, which contains device information details like the **MAC address**. Please copy or download this code to use for either activation method.
