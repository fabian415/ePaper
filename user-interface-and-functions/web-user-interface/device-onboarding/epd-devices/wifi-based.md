## Search and install the APP

> EPD WiFi Connector is a utility app produced by Advantech, which can be used to assist Advantech's electronic paper devices (EPD models: EPD-562, EPD-662, EPD-660, EPD-765, EPD-763, EPD-258) to connect DeviceOn/ePaper server through Bluetooth. Users can connect EPD devices to DeviceOn/ePaper through their own WiFi access point. In addition, this utility app has the function of scanning nearby devices, connecting multiple devices, and blinking LED lights at the same time. Plus, this utility can keep records of connection, which is convenient for users to carry out the next deployment.
