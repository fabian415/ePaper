# üîê Security Architecture

System Security is about not only installing and onboarding devices and networks securely but also managing their ongoing operations throughout their lifecycle and identifying and isolating any threats. Industries everywhere are digitizing, which is creating a multitude of new security requirements for the Internet of Things (IoT). End-to-end (E2E) security management will be essential to ensuring security and privacy in the IoT, while simultaneously building strong identities and maintaining trust. As the diversity of IoT services and the number of connected devices continue to increase, the threats to IoT systems are changing and growing even faster.

A comprehensive model of IoT device security, as shown below structure, the comprehensive IoT module security in an IoT system has three main parts:

## Device Security

DeviceOn/ePaper Server leverages McAfee Embedded Security software to prevent unauthorized changes and will lock a system down to a known application is an industry, that‚Äôs an industrial first solution to secure embedded devices. For disaster recovery, Acronis provides users with a quick and easy-operated solution to protect data and recover the entire system even when OS crashes, effectively reducing down-time cost and lowering the risk of data loss. In the Zigbee solution at the edge, during the EPD device joining the network, the EPD router uses EPID (Extended PAN ID) to create a private network to filter non-EPD devices. EPD device is a wireless microcontroller unit (MCU). It has a built-in hardware accelerator for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, which is commonly used for secure data communication over wireless networks. The encryption protocol of the Wi-Fi solution is WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2), which provides encryption to protect data from being intercepted or tampered with during transmission.

## Secure Transporty

The server distributed SSL certificates to use TLS (v-1.3) as an encrypted and secure data transmission channel, and the device default enabled MQTT-SSL for communication.

* Topics Isolation and Unique Device IoT Key

Topics are specially handled in RabbitMQ. Topics are not public. Access control isolates an activated device from publishing/subscribing only to that device‚Äôs topics even though multiple devices will have subscriptions to identically named topics. A device is not allowed to subscribe/publish to another device‚Äôs topics. Second, in IoT applications, command topics are used to control a device remotely and to acknowledge successful command executions. Unlike telemetry, command topics are not read-only. Commands are a back-and-forth workflow that can occur **between the cloud and devices**. Because commands are actionable messages, **isolate the MQTT topic for command messages from telemetry topics**.

* Use x.509 Certificates to Authenticate Edge Device

DeviceOn/ePaper supports x.509 certificate authentication for use with a secure TLS/SSL connection. The x.509 edge device authentication **allows devices to authenticate to servers with certificates rather than with a username and password**.

* ~~Use TPM + x.509 Certificates to Provide Higher Security~~

~~The solution that we integrate on DeviceOn/ePaper for Azure (Enterprise Edition), leverages Azure IoT Edge and TPM 2.0 to offer secure authentication and private key protection. TPM, also known as ISO/IEC 11889, is a standard for securely generating and storing cryptographic keys. TPM also refers to a virtual or physical I/O device that interacts with modules that implement the standard. A TPM device can exist as discrete hardware, integrated hardware, a firmware-based module, or a software-based module.~~

## Secure Cloud Service

The cloud service components include Tomcat as a web server that provides an HTTPS protocol and backend API services, each connection between the backend and database adopts SSL encryption and enforces password policies. Second, for an advanced attack, such as SQL injection, XXC, or local and remote file vulnerabilities, the Nginx+Naxsi to achieve Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection. All DeviceOn/ePaper services pass through famous vulnerability tools to ensure security for your it IoT solutions, and the binary uses ProGuard code obfuscation protection. The API authentication uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to hide/encrypt sensitive data for security.

## Role-based Access Control (RBAC)

DeviceOn/ePaper supports three different user [roles](http://ess-wiki.advantech.com.tw/view/File:Role\_Permission.xlsx) - ‚ÄúRoot‚Äù, ‚ÄúSystem Admin‚Äù and ‚ÄúDevice Admin‚Äù. There is only one single ‚ÄúRoot‚Äù account per system, which has the highest permission level and can create ‚ÄúSystem Admin‚Äù or ‚ÄúDevice Admin‚Äù accounts. The intermediate user level ‚ÄúSystem Admin‚Äù can be used to create ‚ÄúDevice Admin‚Äù accounts. ‚ÄúDevice Admin‚Äù accounts have the lowest permission level.

## SSL Encryption

* _HTTPS on DeviceOn/ePaper Web Server_

The principal motivations for HTTPS are authentication of the accessed website, and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data while in transit. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks. The bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and server protects against eavesdropping and tampering of the communication.

* _SSL Connection on Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)_

PostgreSQL and MongoDB have native support for using SSL connections to encrypt client/server communications for increased security.

* _Create Security Credentials on Database_

Databases are by default protected by secure credentials and require explicit authentication for connections. This avoids accidentally deploying platforms with unprotected access.

* _Device Connectivity via MQTT SSL_

RabbitMQ supports multiple protocols including MQTT, which is the most popular IoT (Internet of Things) protocol. By default, SSL is used to encrypt all MQTT traffic for device connectivity.

* _Enforce Password Policies_

While DeviceOn/ePaper allows you to set some of your passwords, please make sure those meet the minimum complexity requirements established by your specific organization.

## Vulnerability Scanning Tools

The DeviceOn/ePaper server pass through below famous vulnerability tools to ensure security for your AIoT solutions. Furthermore, all the testing including anti-malware (Trend Micro and Kaspersky)
